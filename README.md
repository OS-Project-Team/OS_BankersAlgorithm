# OS_BankersAlgorithm
This is a project to implement Bankers algorithm.

Bankers algorithm is a method of deadlock avoidance and deadlock detection.

MultiThreads are used to request and release resources for running processes.

Mutex lock is used to avoid race condition and achieve synchronization while requesting and releasing resources.
